# PROGRESS.md — Living Changelog for DLCD Neural Accelerator

## M0 — Python Golden Model (Complete)
- Implemented Q4.12 fixed-point arithmetic in `python_golden_model/fixed_point_math.py`
- Functions: to_q4_12, from_q4_12, mul_q4_12, add_q4_12, relu_q4_12
- Sequential MAC with truncation at each step matches hardware behavior
- Verified against hand-calculated examples

## M1 — MAC & ReLU Hardware (Complete)
- Built `mac_q4_12.v` (combinational multiply-accumulate with Q4.12 truncation)
- Built `relu_q4_12.v` (combinational ReLU)
- Self-checking testbench `tb_mac_relu.v` with 100 random vectors
- All 100 tests pass against Python golden model
- Tagged `M1`

## M2 — Systolic Processing Element (Complete)
- Built `systolic_pe.v` with weight-stationary dataflow and register-passing
- Fixed load/compute race: made `load_weight` and compute branches mutually exclusive in same clock edge
- Cycle-accurate testbench `tb_systolic_pe.v` with 3-cycle protocol (load → compute → check)
- 100/100 vectors pass, timing verified
- Built `systolic_array_l1.v` — 16×100 grid (1,600 PEs) elaborates clean
- Tagged `M2`

## M3 — Array Golden Model + Array Testbench (In Progress)
- Created `array_golden_model.py` — generates 16×100 weight matrix + 100-element input + 16 expected outputs
- Uses sequential Q4.12 MAC (not numpy.dot) to match hardware rounding
- Exported test vectors to `verilog_src/array_*.hex`
- Next: build `tb_systolic_array_l1.v` with analytical wait-cycle checking
